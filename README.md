# My-first-database-L9

# About the task
This task is about creating my first database and writing some basic SQL queries that retrieve data from the database.

# Case
- The created database is a simple database with at two tables. This has helped to be familiar with the SSMS tool and be able to work with different data types.

# What to do

- Create a database using a query in SSMS environment by connecting to the local server on my computer.

- The database is named as 'TestDatabase'.

- Created two tables with queries: Teams & Players.

- Have set and used primary key and foreign key in the tables.

- Joined two tables with a "simple" relationship.

- Couldn't create database diagram due to iOS, Azure data Studio. It doesn't have the feature. Tried with other third party applications, but didn't work out.
