# My-first-database-L9

# About the task
This task is about creating my first database and writing some basic SQL queries that retrieve data from the database.

# Case
- The database to be created is a simple database with at least two tables.
- We should be familiar with the SSMS tool and be able to work with different data types.

# What to do

- Open SSMS and connect it to the local server on your computer.

- Create a database using a query.

- The database should be called TestDatabase.

- Create two or three tables with queries.

- You must use primary key and foreign key in the tables.

- Join two tables with a "simple" relationship.

- Do the same steps graphically with a different database name for reference. Feel free to create a database diagram.

# Tip
If you're having trouble figuring out what the tables should contain, here are five different suggestions:
- E-commerce Theme: Customers, Orders
- Financial theme: Personnel, salary payments
- Animal theme: Animal breeds and feed types
- Sports Theme: Teams, Players
